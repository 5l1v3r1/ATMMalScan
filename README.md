# Introduction
ATMMalScan is a commandline tool for Windows operating systems version 7 and higher, which helps to search for malware traces on an ATM during the DFIR process. This tool examines the running processes of a system, as well as the hard disk, depending on the specified file path. To scan a system, a user with standard rights is sufficient. However, ATMMalScan provides the best results with administrator privileges.

# Known issues:
Currently ATMMalScan does not support codepages that require Unicode, this means Windows operating systems that are set to e.g. Cyrillic or Chinese characters, no representative result can be guaranteed.

# Requirements:
Make sure at least Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015 has been installed on the ATM, you like to scan.

# Usage (Example)

Step1 => Scan process memory and disk. ===> Check if Admin privileges are available on the device for best results!

Step2 => ATMMalScan detected a Malware called XFS_DIRECT in a process, gives details about the thread and its rules matches.
Further a full processmemory dump has been saved to disk, to catch the malicious process,
its modules, as well as its stack and heap pages.
